# crypto-hs

## What is this?
This is my crypto playground with haskell. I try to learn both at the same time.
This is not meant to be complete solution to anything or be 100% correct!

## What do you need to run it?
- [haskell stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)
- build with `stack build`
- run with `stack exec crypto-hs-exe`
- run tests with `stack test`
